## Background Information on App.

This weather app is instrumental in providing users with accurate weather information across all available locations. The app has an easy UI feel for all the users as the app is primarily meant to fit the aesthetics of weather hobbyists, tourists, tour companies etc. 

This app is pro-active and takes a center forward approach that ensures the users' needs are well taken care of.


## Overview
This Weather App is a React-based application designed to provide users with weather information for a selected city. It includes various components for displaying weather data, managing forecasts, and navigating through different sections of the applications.

This app offers users the ultimate experience by protecting the user from spammy ads. 

At Monstro, we create Monstro for our people. Our people deserve the best.

Monstro To The World.

## Components Used.

- NavBar.js
- About.js
- TemperatureConverter.js
- WeatherComparison.js
- WeatherCard.js
- WeatherForm.js
- BackgroundDisplay.js

## Brief Explanations
Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. NavBar.js: This file likely contains the code for the navigation bar component of your web application. It typically includes links or buttons for navigating   between different pages or sections of the website.

2. About.js: This file probably contains the code for the "About" page or section of your web application. It could include information about the purpose of the application, its creators, or any other relevant details.

3. TemperatureConverter.js: This file may contain the code for a component responsible for converting temperatures between different units, such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin. It could be part of a weather-related application or utility.

4. WeatherComparison.js: This file likely contains the code for a component that compares weather data between different locations or time periods. It could display charts, graphs, or tables to visualize the comparison.

5. WeatherCard.js: This file probably contains the code for a component that displays weather information for a specific location in a card-like format. It could include details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

6. WeatherForm.js: This file may contain the code for a form component used to input location or search criteria for fetching weather data. Users might enter a city name, ZIP code, or coordinates to retrieve relevant weather information.

7. BackgroundDisplay.js: This file likely contains the code for a component responsible for displaying background images or colors based on weather conditions, time of day, or other factors. It could enhance the visual appeal of the application.

This components are essential in helping us organize and modularize our code for easier development and maintenance.

## Features
